alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in
it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or
conversations

so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure
of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her

there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear
oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time
it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on
alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch
to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field
after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbithole under the hedge

in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again

the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then
dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep
well

either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was
going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what
she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she
looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as
she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great
disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
she fell past it

well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at
home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top
of the house which was very likely true

down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how
many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting
somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four
thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several
things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this
was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there
was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over
yes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude
or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or
longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say

presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the
earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with
their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad
there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the
right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country
is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and
she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling
through the air do you think you could manage it and what an
ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to
ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere

down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began
talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think
dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at
teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no
mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very
like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice
began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy
sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do
bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question
it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing
off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth
did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over

alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment
she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another
long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it
there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and
was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears
and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she
turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof

there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when
alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every
door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to
get out again

suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid
glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall
but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small
but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second
time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the
little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted

alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not
much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of
that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the
doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it
would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could
shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin
for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately
that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really
impossible

there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went
back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this
time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here
before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large
letters

it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was
not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and
see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice
little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild
beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember
the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot
poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your
finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never
forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is
almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later

however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste
it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour
of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot
buttered toast she very soon finished it off

                          

                        

                          

what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a
telescope

and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden first however she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further
she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said
alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder
what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing

after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going
into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the
door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she
went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach
it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery
and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing
sat down and cried

come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself
rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally
gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people
why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person

soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table
she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words
eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said
alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it
makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill
get into the garden and i dont care which happens

she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which
way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway
things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on
in the common way

so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake

                          

                        

                          




chapter ii the pool of tears

curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet
for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of
sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder
who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure
i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be
kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want
to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas

and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must
go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending
presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look

     alices right foot esq
       hearthrug
         near the fender
           with alices love

oh dear what nonsense im talking

just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was
now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door

poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to
look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more
hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again

you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like
you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this
moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of
tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall

after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white
rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great
hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit
came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir
the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go

alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how
queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual
i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the
same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a
little different but if im not the same the next question is who
in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking
over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to
see if she could have been changed for any of them

im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long
ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant
be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a
very little besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling
it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me
see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and
four times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate
however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography
london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and
romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for
mabel ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her
hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it
but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the
same as they used to do

     how doth the little crocodile
      improve his shining tail
     and pour the waters of the nile
      on every golden scale

     how cheerfully he seems to grin
      how neatly spread his claws
     and welcome little fishes in
      with gently smiling jaws

im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and
i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to
no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive
made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i
shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then
if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here
till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst
of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired
of being all alone here

as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while
she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must
be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now
about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found
out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped
it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether

that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the
sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and
now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door
but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was
lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever
thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never
and i declare its too bad that it is

as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash
she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she
had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by
railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in
her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go
to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row
of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon
made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high

i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying
to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by
being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure
however everything is queer today

just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small
she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself

would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse
everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very
likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she
began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired
of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but
she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof
a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes
but it said nothing

perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its
a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all
her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened so she began again ou est ma chatte which
was the first sentence in her french lessonbook the mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright
oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt
the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats

not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would
you like cats if you were me

well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry
about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet
thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the
pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and
washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes
such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried
alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she
felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any
more if youd rather not

we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his
tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated
cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again

i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation are youare you fondofof dogs the mouse did not
answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near
our house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you
know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when
you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts
of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer
you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he
says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a sorrowful
tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went

so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we
wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the
mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its
face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low
trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my
history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs

it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo
a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the
way and the whole party swam to the shore




chapter iii a caucusrace and a long tale

they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe
birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close
to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable

the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a
consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had
known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the
lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than
you and must know better and this alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its
age there was no more to be said

at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them
called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you
dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse
in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon

ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this
is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william
the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted
to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of
mercia and northumbria

ugh said the lory with a shiver

i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did
you speak

not i said the lory hastily

i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar
the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand
the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable

found what said the duck

found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what
it means

i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the
duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the
archbishop find

the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found
it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the
crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his
normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning
to alice as it spoke

as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to
dry me at all

in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move
that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies

speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half
those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and
the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds
tittered audibly

what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace

what is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted much to know
but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything

why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as
you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell
you how the dodo managed it

first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact
shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed
along the course here and there there was no one two three and
away but they began running when they liked and left off when they
liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however
when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again
the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded
round it panting and asking but who has won

this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures
of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said
everybody has won and all must have prizes

but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked

why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger
and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused
way prizes prizes

alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had
not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one
apiece all round

but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse

of course the dodo replied very gravely what else have you got in
your pocket he went on turning to alice

only a thimble said alice sadly

hand it over here said the dodo

then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly
presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered

alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything
to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she
could

the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and
confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and
begged the mouse to tell them something more

you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why
it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it
would be offended again

mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and
sighing

it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at
the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling
about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was
something like this

         fury said to a
         mouse that he
        met in the
       house
     let us
      both go to
       law i will
        prosecute
         youcome
           ill take no
           denial we
          must have a
        trial for
      really this
     morning ive
    nothing
    to do
     said the
      mouse to the
       cur such
        a trial
         dear sir
            with
          no jury
        or judge
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath
       ill be
        judge ill
         be jury
            said
         cunning
          old fury
          ill
          try the
            whole
            cause
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death


you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you
thinking of

i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth
bend i think

i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily

a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking
anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it

i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking
away you insult me by talking such nonsense

i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended
you know

the mouse only growled in reply

please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the
others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook
its head impatiently and walked a little quicker

what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite
out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her
daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose
your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little
snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster

i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing
nobody in particular shed soon fetch it back

and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the
lory

alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet
dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you
cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why
shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it

this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the
birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully remarking i really must be getting home the nightair
doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to
its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed
on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone

i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy
tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best
cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very
lonely and lowspirited in a little while however she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up
eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming
back to finish his story




chapter iv the rabbit sends in a little bill

it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking
anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard
it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh
my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are
ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves
and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door
had vanished completely

very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and
called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing
out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan
quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once
in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it
had made

he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how
surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him
his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them as she said this she
came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without
knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the
real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves

how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for
a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come
here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute
nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont
think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that

by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves
and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time
with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it
to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said
to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what
this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really
im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing

it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had
drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put
down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant
grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt
drunk quite so much

alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there
was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out
of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i
can do no more whatever happens what will become of me

luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect
and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again no wonder she felt unhappy

it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt
always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand
yetits rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what
can have happened to me when i used to read fairytales i fancied that
kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one
there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i
grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful
tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here

but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am
now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old womanbut
thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like that

oh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you learn
lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all
for any lessonbooks

and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making
quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard
a voice outside and stopped to listen

mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was
the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the
house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large
as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it

presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as
the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it
that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill
go round and get in at the window

that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied
she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her
hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything
but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumberframe or something of the sort

next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are you and
then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging
for apples yer honour

digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and
help me out of this sounds of more broken glass

now tell me pat whats that in the window

sure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum

an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole
window

sure it does yer honour but its an arm for all that

well its got no business there at any rate go and take it away

there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers
now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at
all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her
hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were
two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of
cucumberframes there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do
next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im
sure i dont want to stay in here any longer

she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices
all talking together she made out the words wheres the other
ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill
fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em
together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh theyll
do well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this
ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming
down heads below a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i
fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i
wont thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to
herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in
bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but
i think i can kick a little

she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited
till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then
saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to
see what would happen next

the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill
then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the hedge then
silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy
nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow what happened to you tell
us all about it

last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought
alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im
a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me
like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket

so you did old fellow said the others

we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called
out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at you

there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i
wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the
roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and
alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with

a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this
she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again
which produced another dead silence

alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her
head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make
some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must
make me smaller i suppose

so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through
the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little
animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was
in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it
something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she
appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood

the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered
about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second
thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be
the best plan

it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply
arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry

an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and
feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing
said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but
she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be
hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of
all her coaxing

hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and
held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick
and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle
to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the
other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely
all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut

this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she
set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and
till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance

and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the
leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id
only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that
ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i
suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great
question is what

the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as
herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and
behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it

she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar
that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long
hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else




chapter v advice from a caterpillar

the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence
at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed
her in a languid sleepy voice

who are you said the caterpillar

this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied
rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know
who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been
changed several times since then

what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain
yourself

i cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not
myself you see

i dont see said the caterpillar

im afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely
for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing

it isnt said the caterpillar

well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you
have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then
after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little
queer wont you

not a bit said the caterpillar

well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know
is it would feel very queer to me

you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you

which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very
short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think
you ought to tell me who you are first

why said the caterpillar

here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any
good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant
state of mind she turned away

come back the caterpillar called after her ive something important
to say

this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again

keep your temper said the caterpillar

is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she
could

no said the caterpillar

alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and
perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some
minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its
arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think
youre changed do you

im afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i
usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together

cant remember what things said the caterpillar

well ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came
different alice replied in a very melancholy voice

repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar
